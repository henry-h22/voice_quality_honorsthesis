Hi! This is a space where I'm keeping code as I work through my undergraduate honor's thesis.

Essentially I'm expanding on this paper:

Jianjing Kuang, Patricia Keating; Vocal fold vibratory patterns in tense versus lax phonation contrasts. J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 1 November 2014; 136 (5): 2784–2797.

Using data from here:

https://www.phonetics.ucla.edu/voiceproject/voice.html
(see also https://github.com/scjs/ucla-voice-quality)

In order to explore the cross-linguistic classification of phonemic phonation.
